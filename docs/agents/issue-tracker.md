# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for enochWIKI live as markdown files in `.scratch/`. This repo has **no git
remote**, so work is tracked locally. (Switch to GitHub/GitLab/Linear by re-running
`/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.)

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see
  `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## External PRs as a triage surface

No — local markdown has no PRs. `/triage` only processes issue files under `.scratch/`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number
directly.
